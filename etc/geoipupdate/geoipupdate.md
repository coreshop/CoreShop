# NAME

geoipupdate - GeoIP2, GeoLite2, and GeoIP Legacy Update Program

# SYNOPSIS

**geoipupdate** [-Vvh] [-f *CONFIG_FILE*] [-d *TARGET_DIRECTORY*]

# DESCRIPTION

`geoipupdate` automatically updates GeoIP2, GeoLite2, and GeoIP Legacy
databases. The program connects to the MaxMind GeoIP Update server to
check for new databases. If a new database is available, the program will
download and install it.

If you are using a firewall, you must have the DNS and HTTPS ports
open.

# OPTIONS

`-d`, `--database-directory`

:   Install databases to a custom directory.  This is optional. If provided, it
    overrides any `DatabaseDirectory` set in the configuration file.

`-f`, `--config-file`

:   The configuration file to use. See `GeoIP.conf` and its documentation for
    more information. This is optional. It defaults to /usr/local/etc/GeoIP.conf.

`-h`, `--help`

:   Display help and exit.

`--stack-trace`

:   Show a stack trace on any error message. This is primarily useful for
    debugging.

`-V`, `--version`

:   Display version information and exit.

`-v`, `--verbose`

:   Enable verbose mode. Prints out the steps that `geoipupdate` takes.

# EXIT STATUS

`geoipupdate` returns 0 on success and 1 on error.

# NOTES

Typically you should run `geoipupdate` weekly. On most Unix-like systems,
this can be achieved by using cron. Below is a sample crontab file that
runs `geoipupdate` on each Wednesday at noon:

    # top of crontab

    MAILTO=your@email.com

    0 12 * * 3 geoipupdate

    # end of crontab


To use with a proxy server, update your `GeoIP.conf` file as specified
in the `GeoIP.conf` man page or set the `http_proxy` environment
variable.
