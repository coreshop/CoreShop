# Contributing to CoreShop

## Bug Reports & Feature Requests
The CoreShop team heavily uses (and loves!) GitHub for all of our software management. 
We use GitHub issues exclusively to track all bugs and features.

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/issues) here on GitHub. 
If you can, **please provide a fix and create a pull request (PR) instead**; this will automatically create an issue for you.
* Report security issues only to info@coreshop.org 
* Please be patient as not all items will be tested immediately - remember, CoreShop is open source and free of charge. 
* Occasionally we'll close issues if they appear stale or are too vague - please don't take this personally! 
Please feel free to re-open issues we've closed if there's something we've missed and they still need to be addressed.

## Contributing Pull Requests
PR's are even better than issues. 
We gladly accept community pull requests. 
There are a few necessary steps before we can accept a pull request:

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/issues) describing the problem that you are looking to solve in 
your PR (if one is not already open), and your approach to solving it (not necessary for bug fixes - only for feature contributions). 
* [Fork us!](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) Code! Follow the coding standards PSR-1 and PSR-2
* [Send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from your fork’s branch to our `master` branch.

## Set up local development environment
