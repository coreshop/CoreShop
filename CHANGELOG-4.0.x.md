## 4.0.0-beta.2
 - CoreShop 4.0.0 is the same as 3.2.0 will be, it contains all bug-fixes and feature from 3.1 and 3.2

## 4.0.0-beta.1

> CoreShop 4.0.0 is the same as 3.1.0, but with Pimcore 11 compatibility. Updating CoreShop therefore is quite easy. Since Symfony now doesn't have a full container anymore, we use Service Containers now for our Controllers. So your overwritten Controllers probably need changes.

 - Pimcore 11 Compatibility (https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2252, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2340, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2345, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2352, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2321, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2347)
