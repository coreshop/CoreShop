    Given the product "Shoe 2" has a variant "Shoe 2 Variant" priced at 150
    Given it is in category "Shoes"
    Given the site has a product "Jacket" priced at 400
    Given the product "Jacket" has a variant "Jacket Variant" priced at 400
    Given it is in category "Coats"
    Then the product "Shoe" should be priced at "100"
