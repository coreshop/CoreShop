  As a logged in customer

  Background:
    Given the site operates on a store in "Austria"
    And the site has a currency "Euro" with iso "EUR"
    And I am in country "Austria"
    And the site has a tax rate "AT" with "20%" rate
    And the site has a tax rule group "AT"
    And the tax rule group has a tax rule for country "Austria" with tax rate "AT"
    And the site has a product "Shoe" priced at 10000
    And the product has the tax rule group "AT"
    And the site has a carrier "Post"
    And adding a shipping rule named "post"
    And the shipping rule is active
    And the shipping rule has a action price of 20 in currency "EUR"
    And the shipping rule belongs to carrier "Post"
    And the site has a customer "some-customer@something.com"
    And the customer "some-customer@something.com" has an address with country "Austria", "4600", "Wels", "Freiung", "9-11/N3"
    And the cart belongs to customer "some-customer@something.com"
    And the cart ships to customer "some-customer@something.com" address with postcode "4600"
    And the cart invoices to customer "some-customer@something.com" address with postcode "4600"

  Scenario: The default resolved shipping for my cart should be 20
    Given I add the product "Shoe" to my cart
    Then the cart shipping should be "2000" excluding tax

  Scenario: The default resolved shipping for my cart should be 40
    Given the shipping rule has a condition postcode with "4700"
    And the site has another carrier "DPD"
    And adding a shipping rule named "DPD"
    And the shipping rule is active
    And the shipping rule has a action price of 40 in currency "EUR"
    And the shipping rule belongs to carrier "DPD"
    And I add the product "Shoe" to my cart
    Then the shipping rule "Post" should be invalid for my cart with carrier "Post"
    And the cart shipping should be "4000" excluding tax

  Scenario: The site has 2 carriers and should resolve to the first default one
    Given the site has another carrier "DPD"
    And adding a shipping rule named "DPD"
