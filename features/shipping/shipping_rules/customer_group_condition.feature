    And I am customer "some-customer@something.com"
    And the site has a tax rate "AT" with "20%" rate
    And the site has a tax rule group "AT"
    And the tax rule group has a tax rule for country "Austria" with tax rate "AT"

    And I add the product "Shoe" to my cart
    And the cart belongs to customer "some-customer@something.com"
    And the site has a carrier "Post"

    Given adding a shipping rule named "customer-groups"
    And the shipping rule is inactive
