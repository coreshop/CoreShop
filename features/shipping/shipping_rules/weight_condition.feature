Feature: Adding a new Shipping Rule
  In order to calculate shipping
  I'll create a new shipping rule
  with an weight condition

  Background:
    Given the site operates on a store in "Austria"
    And the site has a currency "Euro" with iso "EUR"
    And I am in country "Austria"
    And the site has a tax rate "AT" with "20%" rate
    And the site has a tax rule group "AT"
    And the tax rule group has a tax rule for country "Austria" with tax rate "AT"
    And the site has a product "Shoe" priced at 10000
    And the product weighs 10kg
    And the product has the tax rule group "AT"
    And I add the product "Shoe" to my cart
    And the site has a carrier "Post"
    Then the cart should weigh 10kg

  Scenario: Add a new weight shipping rule which is valid
    Given adding a shipping rule named "weight"
    And the shipping rule is active
    And the shipping rule has a condition weight from "5" to "15"
    Then the shipping rule should be valid for my cart with carrier "Post"

  Scenario: Add a new weight shipping rule which is inactive
    Given adding a shipping rule named "weight"
    And the shipping rule is inactive
    And the shipping rule has a condition weight from "5" to "15"
    Then the shipping rule should be invalid for my cart with carrier "Post"

  Scenario: Add a new weight shipping rule which is invalid
    Given adding a shipping rule named "amount"
    And the shipping rule is active
    And the shipping rule has a condition weight from "20" to "30"
    Then the shipping rule should be invalid for my cart with carrier "Post"

  Scenario: Add a new weight shipping rule which is valid with floating numbers
    Given adding a shipping rule named "amount"
    And the shipping rule is active
    And the site has a product "Dress" priced at 10000
    And the product weighs 4.2kg
    And the product has the tax rule group "AT"
    And I add the product "Dress" to my cart
    And the shipping rule has a condition weight from "14.19" to "30.95"
    Then the shipping rule should be valid for my cart with carrier "Post"
