Feature: Adding a new Shipping Rule
  In order to calculate shipping
  I'll create a new shipping rule
  with an country condition

  Background:
    Given the site operates on a store in "Austria"
    And the site has a customer "some-customer@something.com"
    And the customer "some-customer@something.com" has an address with country "Austria", "4600", "Wels", "Freiung", "9-11/N3"
    And I am customer "some-customer@something.com"
    And the site has a currency "Euro" with iso "EUR"
    And I am in country "Austria"
    And the site has a tax rate "AT" with "20%" rate
    And the site has a tax rule group "AT"
    And the tax rule group has a tax rule for country "Austria" with tax rate "AT"
    And the site has a product "Shoe" priced at 10000
    And the product has the tax rule group "AT"
    And I add the product "Shoe" to my cart
    And the cart belongs to customer "some-customer@something.com"
    And the cart ships to customer "some-customer@something.com" first address
    And the site has a carrier "Post"

  Scenario: Add a new country shipping rule which is valid
    Given adding a shipping rule named "country"
    And the shipping rule is active
    And the shipping rule has a condition countries with country "Austria"
    Then the shipping rule should be valid for my cart with carrier "Post"

  Scenario: Add a new country shipping rule which is inactive
    Given adding a shipping rule named "country"
    And the shipping rule is inactive
    And the shipping rule has a condition countries with country "Austria"
    Then the shipping rule should be invalid for my cart with carrier "Post"

  Scenario: Add a new country shipping rule which is invalid
    Given adding a shipping rule named "amount"
    And the shipping rule is active
    And the site has a country "Germany" with currency "EUR"
    And the customer "some-customer@something.com" has an address with country "Austria", "4720", "Anytown", "Anystreet", "9"
    And the cart ships to customer "some-customer@something.com" address with postcode "4720"
    And the shipping rule has a condition countries with country "Germany"
    Then the shipping rule should be invalid for my cart with carrier "Post"

  Scenario: Add a new country shipping rule which is valid for a different country
    Given adding a shipping rule named "amount"
    And the shipping rule is active
    And the site has a country "Germany" with currency "EUR"
    And the customer "some-customer@something.com" has an address with country "Germany", "47200", "Anytown", "Anystreet", "9"
    And the cart ships to customer "some-customer@something.com" address with postcode "47200"
    And the shipping rule has a condition countries with country "Germany"
    Then the shipping rule should be valid for my cart with carrier "Post"
