Feature: In Order to make checkout easier
  I create one carrier which will be defaulted
  As an anonymous customer

  Background:
    Given the site operates on a store in "Austria"
    And the site has a currency "Euro" with iso "EUR"
    And I am in country "Austria"
    And the site has a tax rate "AT" with "20%" rate
    And the site has a tax rule group "AT"
    And the tax rule group has a tax rule for country "Austria" with tax rate "AT"
    And the site has a product "Shoe" priced at 10000
    And the product has the tax rule group "AT"
    And the site has a carrier "Post"
    And adding a shipping rule named "post"
    And the shipping rule is active
    And the shipping rule has a action price of 20 in currency "EUR"
    And the shipping rule belongs to carrier "Post"

  Scenario: Default carrier resolver with an anonymous customer
    Given I add the product "Shoe" to my cart
    Then the cart should use carrier "Post"
    And the cart shipping should be "2000" excluding tax

  Scenario: Default carrier resolver without valid carrier and an anonymous customer
    Given the site has a country "Germany" with currency "EUR"
    And the shipping rule has a condition countries with country "Germany"
    And I add the product "Shoe" to my cart
    Then the cart should not have a carrier
