## Exchange Rates

CoreShop supports automated calculation of exchange rates, simplifying the process of maintaining current and accurate
currency information. This feature is particularly useful for stores that handle transactions in multiple currencies and
need to ensure consistent and fair pricing across different regions.

> **Important**: Regular updates of exchange rates are necessary for accurate currency conversion.
