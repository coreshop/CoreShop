# Upgrade Notes

Always check this page for some important upgrade notes before updating to the latest coreshop build.

# 4.0.0-beta.1

> CoreShop 4.0.0 is the same as 3.1.0, but with Pimcore 11 compatibility. Updating CoreShop therefore is quite easy.
> Since Symfony now doesn't have a full container anymore, we use Service Containers now for our Controllers. So your
> overwritten Controllers probably need changes.

- Pimcore 11
  Compatibility (https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2252, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2340, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2345, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2352, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2321, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/2347)

## Pimcore 10.6

If you update to Pimcore 10.6 and you get following
error: ```"You have requested a non-existent parameter "coreshop.model.user.class"``` then check if you have this config
in your `security.yaml`:

```yaml
pimcore:
  security:
    encoder_factories:
      ‘%coreshop.model.user.class%’: coreshop.security.user.password_encoder_factory
```

If you have that, remove that entry. CoreShop internally sets that anyway.

Also check the priority of which the `CoreShopCoreBundle` gets loaded. It has to be loaded before Pimcore, so set the
priority to '1000':

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Pimcore\HttpKernel\BundleCollection\BundleCollection;
use Pimcore\Kernel as PimcoreKernel;

class Kernel extends PimcoreKernel
{
    public function registerBundlesToCollection(BundleCollection $collection)
    {
        $collection->addBundle(new \CoreShop\Bundle\CoreBundle\CoreShopCoreBundle(), 1000);
    }
}
```

### 2.1.0

- BC-Break: Introduced `array $options` parameter into `CoreShop\Component\Index\Listing\ListingInterface` to allow
  certain variations for loading data

- Introduced WholesalePrice Calculators, this deprecates the "wholesalePrice" property in the Product Class and adds
  the "wholesaleBuyingPrice" Property with a currency attached. We've added a migration for that, but since we need a
  currency now, we just assume the buying currency as the defaults store currency. If you have a different one, create a
  custom migration that changes it.

- `CoreShop\Component\StorageList\StorageListModifierInterface` got completely refactored and works a bit different now.
  Since deciding what StorageListItem belongs to what product, can be a bit more complicated, we decided to introduce a
  BC break.
    - `CoreShop\Component\StorageList\StorageListModifierInterface` added `addToList` function
    - `CoreShop\Component\StorageList\StorageListModifierInterface` removed `remove` to `removeFromList`
    - `CoreShop\Component\StorageList\Model\StorageListItemInterface` added `equals` function
    - `CoreShop\Component\StorageList\Model\StorageListInterface` removed `getItemForProduct` function
    - `CoreShop\Component\StorageList\Model\StorageListProductInterface` got deprecated, since not it's not needed
      anymore
- `CoreShop\Component\Order\Factory\CartItemFactoryInterface` introduced a new
  function `public function createWithPurchasable(PurchasableInterface $purchasable, $quantity = 1);`

- Introduced Theme-Bundle to handle
  Themes (https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/749, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/756, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/755)

- Introduce AddToCartFormType and QuantityType. This allows to use validators to check if its allowed to add a product
  to the cart. If you update from CoreShop 2.0.* change the add-to-cart form in your templates to the
  following: (https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/812/files#diff-3e06a5f0e813be230a0cd232e916738eL29) (https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/812, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/864)
    - `{{ render(url('coreshop_cart_add', {'product': product.id})) }}`
    - Be sure you have adopted the new form template in `views/Product/_addToCart.html.twig`

- Introduced Store
  Unit: (https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/877, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/883, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/950, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/902, https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/pull/896)
    - Please add `product_unit` to permission table.
    - Remove `storePrice` field from all product classes
    - If you don't use the `Store Price` element in your classes besides the `storePrice` field, you should delete
      the `coreshop_product_store_price` table after migration.
    - We introduced a new jquery plugin `$.coreshopQuantitySelector()` which allows you to add more numeric control to
      your quantity field, checkout our
      demo [example](https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/blob/7d05ccd89aed99f9fd93c585e096cd1edaf20010/src/CoreShop/Bundle/FrontendBundle/Resources/public/static/js/shop.js#L20).

### 2.0.0-RC.1

- Flash Messages are translated in the Controllers now, not in views anymore. If you have custom Flash Messages,
  translate them in your Controller instead of the view.

### 2.0.0-beta.4

- Completely remove FOSRestBundle, you still can use it, but you need to install it yourself. CoreShop only used the
  BodyListener to decode POST/PUT Requests, this Listener is now added by CoreShop if FOSRestBundle is not installed.

## 2.0.0-beta.3 to 2.0.0-beta.4

- **BC break**: All occurrences of
  parameters `coreshop.all.stack.pimcore_class_ids`, `"application".model."class".pimcore_class_id`, `coreshop.all.pimcore_classes.ids`
  have been removed. Inject the corresponding Repository and use `classId` function instead
- **Pimcore**: CoreShop now requires at least Pimcore 5.4.0. You need to update Pimcore to the at least 5.4.0 in order
  to use/update CoreShop.

### Product Price Calculation

In order to allow custom price calculation on API Level, we changed the way CoreShop calculates product prices by
introducing a new parameter to every PriceCalculation Interface. Price Calculator Conditions are not anymore using a
Live context, instead it gets passed via API.

Following interfaces have changed:

- ```CoreShop\Component\Core\Product\TaxedProductPriceCalculatorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Order\Calculator\PurchasableDiscountCalculatorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Order\Calculator\PurchasableDiscountPriceCalculatorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Order\Calculator\PurchasablePriceCalculatorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Order\Calculator\PurchasableRetailPriceCalculatorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Product\Calculator\ProductDiscountCalculatorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Product\Calculator\ProductDiscountPriceCalculatorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Product\Calculator\ProductPriceCalculatorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Product\Calculator\ProductRetailPriceCalculatorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Product\Rule\Action\ProductDiscountActionProcessorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Product\Rule\Action\ProductDiscountPriceActionProcessorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Product\Rule\Action\ProductDiscountPriceActionProcessorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Product\Rule\Action\ProductPriceActionProcessorInterface```
- ```CoreShop\Component\Product\Rule\Fetcher\ValidRulesFetcherInterface```

If you have anything customized with those classes, please change them accordingly.

If you use the PriceCalculator Service directly, you also need to change the call from

```
$this->priceCalculator->getPrice($object, true)
```

to

```
$this->priceCalculator->getPrice($object, [
    'store' => $store,
    'country' => $country,
    'customer' => $customer,
    'currency' $currency,
    'cart' => $cart
], true)
```

The new second argument, is the Context for which you want to get the Price. This is highly depends on your
need. On a default CoreShop setup, the context can be fetched form the `ShopperContext` Service like this:

```
return  [
    'store' => $this->shopperContext->getStore(),
    'customer' => $this->shopperContext->hasCustomer() ? $this->shopperContext->getCustomer() : null,
    'currency' => $this->shopperContext->getCurrency(),
    'country' => $this->shopperContext->getCountry(),
    'cart' => $this->shopperContext->getCart()
];
```

CoreShop makes that easier for you, you can just use ```$this->shoppperContext->getContext()```. But be aware, the
Shopper Context is only in a Web Request available.
When you work on a CLI Level, you have to define the context yourself.

If you already have a cart and want to calculate the price for the cart, the context is a bit different, cause it
resolves from the cart

```
$context = [
    'store' => $cart->getStore(),
    'customer' => $cart->getCustomer() ?: null,
    'currency' => $cart->getCurrency(),
    'country' => $cart->getStore()->getBaseCountry(),
    'cart' => $cart
];
```

### Taxation

Tax Rule Store relation has been removed as it makes currently no sense.

### Tracking

Tracking bundle has completely been refactored in order to support more use-cases than just ecommerce. If you have any
customizations made, please check the current implementation to adapt your changes.

### Order Invoice

Due to changes in adjustments, we also need to change OrderInvoice/OrderInvoiceItem.

After you have migrated to the latest version you also have to remove some fields:

#### CoreShopOrderInvoice

- totalTax
- baseTotalTax
- subtotalTax
- baseSubtotalTax
- shippingTax
- baseShippingTax
- taxes
- baseTaxes
- discountTax
- baseDiscountTax
- discountNet
- discountGross
- baseDiscountNet
- baseDiscountGross
- shippingNet
- shippingGross
- baseShippingNet
- baseShippingGross
- shippingTaxRate

#### CoreShopOrderInvoiceItem

- totalTax
- baseTotalTax
- taxes
- baseTaxes

### Adjustments

> **BC break / New Feature**

There are several deprecated class fields.
After you have migrated to the latest version you also have to remove them:

#### CoreShopOrder / CoreShopQuote

- shippingGross
- shippingNet
- shippingTax
- discountGross
- discountNet
- discountTax
- baseShippingNet
- baseShippingGross
- baseShippingTax
- baseDiscountNet
- baseDiscountGross
- totalTax
- baseTotalTax
- subTotalTax
- baseSubtotalTax

#### CoreShopOrderItem / CoreShopQuoteItem

- totalTax
- baseTotalTax

#### CoreShopCart

- shippingGross
- shippingNet
- discountGross
- discountNet

## 2.0.0-beta.2 to 2.0.0-beta.3

- **BC break** Signature of following interfaces changed:
    - `CoreShop\Component\Index\Interpreter\InterpreterInterface`: `public function interpret($value, IndexableInterface $object, IndexColumnInterface $config, $interpreterConfig = []);`
    - `CoreShop\Component\Index\Interpreter\LocalizedInterpreterInterface`: `public function interpretForLanguage($language, $value, IndexableInterface $object, IndexColumnInterface $config, $interpreterConfig = []);`
    - `CoreShop\Component\Index\Interpreter\RelationInterpreterInterface`: `public function interpretRelational($value, IndexableInterface $indexable, IndexColumnInterface $config, $interpreterConfig = []);`
    - `CoreShop\Component\Customer\Model\UserInterface::ROLE_DEFAULT`
      renamed `CoreShop\Component\Customer\Model\UserInterface::CORESHOP_ROLE_DEFAULT`
    - `CoreShop\Component\Customer\Model\UserInterface::ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`
      renamed `CoreShop\Component\Customer\Model\UserInterface::CORESHOP_ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`

- **BC break** Shipment / Invoice Creation via API changed
    - Before adding a new Shipment / Invoice you need to dispatch a request state to your order. Read more about
      it [here](../03_Development/06_Order/18_Invoice/01_Invoice_Creation.md)
      and [here](../03_Development/06_Order/19_Shipment/01_Shipment_Creation.md).
- **BC break** getName in `CoreShop\Component\Index\Model\IndexableInterface` has been changed to `getIndexableName`
  as `getName` could eventually conflict with a non localized Pimcore Field
- **BC break** getEnabled in `CoreShop\Component\Index\Model\IndexableInterface` has been changed
  to `getIndexableEnabled` as `getEnabled` could eventually conflict with a localized Pimcore Field

## 2.0.0-beta.1 to 2.0.0-beta.2

- Link Generator implemented. If you want to use nice urls, you need to add the link generator service:
    - CoreShopProduct: add `@coreshop.object.link_generator.product` as Link Provider
    - CoreShopCategory: add `@coreshop.object.link_generator.category` as Link Provider
    - Change `{{ path('') }}` to `{{ coreshop_path('') }}`. You may want to checkout the FrontendBundle to get a deeper
      insight.
- Deprecated Field Names in - CoreShop\Component\Payment\Model\PaymentInterface`:
    - getName is now getTitle
    - getOrderId is now getOrder and directly returns a OrderInterface
- Deprecated Field Names in - `CoreShop\Component\Shipping\Model\CarrierInterface`:
    - getLabel is not getTitle
    - getName is now getIdentifier

## 2.0.0-alpha.4 to 2.0.0-beta.1

- **BC break** Signature of following interfaces changed:
    - `CoreShop\Component\Index\Interpreter\InterpreterInterface`: `public function interpret($value, IndexableInterface $object, IndexColumnInterface $config);`
    - `CoreShop\Component\Index\Interpreter\LocalizedInterpreterInterface`: `public function interpretForLanguage($language, $value, IndexableInterface $object, IndexColumnInterface $config);`
    - `CoreShop\Component\Index\Interpreter\RelationInterpreterInterface`: `public function interpretRelational($value, IndexableInterface $indexable, IndexColumnInterface $config);`

- **BC break** CoreShop now takes advantage of the dependent bundle feature introduced in Pimcore 5.1.2. Therefore,
  all bundles are now automatically loaded. This is a BC break, as when updating, you might run into issues.
  To solve the issues, check following things:
    - remove `RegisterBundles` entry from `app/AppKernel.php`
    - remove loading CoreShopCoreBundle Configuration in `app/config.yml`
    - enable CoreShopCoreBundle via CLI or manually
      in `var/config/extensions.php`: `"CoreShop\\Bundle\\CoreBundle\\CoreShopCoreBundle" => TRUE`
- **BC break** Upgraded Default Layout to Bootstrap 4. This will most certainly cause issues when you just override
  certain templates. Best would be to copy all templates from before the Bootstrap 4 Upgrade.

## 2.0.0-alpha.4 to 2.0.0-alpha.5

- **BC break** added Component\Core\Model\OrderItem and Component\Core\Model\QuoteItem. If you already customized them,
  inherit them from the Core Models.
- **BC break** changed the way CoreShop processes Cart-Rules. If you implemented a custom-condition, inherit
  from `CoreShop\Component\Order\Cart\Rule\Condition\AbstractConditionChecker` and implement `isCartRuleValid` instead
  of `isValid`
- Deprecated: remove `cart/add-price-rule/` static route.

## 2.0.0-alpha.3 to 2.0.0-alpha.4

- **BC break** decoupled MoneyBundle from CurrencyBundle, therefore the Twig Extension for Money Conversion went to the
  CurrencyBundle. Therefore the name of that extension was renamed from
  **coreshop_convert_money** to **coreshop_convert_currency**. If you use it directly in your code, please rename all of
  them.
- Deprecated CoreShopAdminBundle which responsability was only handling installation and deliviering pimcore resources
  like JS and CSS files.
    * Installation has been moved to CoreShopCoreBundle
    * Delivering of resources is now handled by CoreShopResourceBundle, this also makes it easier to use CoreShop
      Bundles without handling resources yourself.

## 2.0.0-alpha.2 to 2.0.0-alpha.3

- **BC break** getPrice in PurchasableInterface and ProductInterface has been removed. In favor of this a new
  coreShopStorePrice editable has been introduced, which stores prices for each store. This makes handling of multiple
  currencies way more elegant.

  If you still want to use the old getPrice, create a new Subclass of \CoreShop\Component\Core\Model\Product, implement
  \CoreShop\Component\Order\Model\PriceAwarePurchasableInterface and set your class to CoreShopProduct parents.

# V1 to V2

- CoreShop 2 is not backward compatible. Due to the framework change, we decided to re-make CoreShop from scratch. If
  you still have instances running and want to migrate, there is a basic migration way which gets you data from V1 to
  V2.
- [Export from CoreShop1](https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShopExport)
- [Import into CoreShop2](https://github.com/coreshop/ImportBundle)

# Within V1

- Nothing available
