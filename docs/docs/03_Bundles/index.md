### Focus on Resource Bundle

One of CoreShop's primary objectives is to provide a flexible framework. The Resource Bundle is a foundational component
that simplifies many common tasks:

- Automates the creation of CRUD controllers (`ResourceController`).
- Streamlines the generation of factories, repositories, routes, and resource controllers for CoreShop resources.

This bundle proves invaluable not only for CoreShop-specific functionalities but also for any Pimcore bundle, offering
extensive utility across various applications. For more details on the Resource Bundle, [click here](./Resource_Bundle).

These bundles collectively enhance the capabilities of your Pimcore installation, providing powerful tools to meet
diverse requirements in a streamlined and efficient manner.
