# Payment

CoreShop features a highly flexible payment management system, supporting a wide range of gateways (payment providers).
It utilizes [Payum](https://github.com/payum/payum), a payment abstraction library, to handle various aspects of payment
processing, including capturing, refunding, and recurring payments.

## Available Payment Gateways for CoreShop

CoreShop supports several payment gateways, each with its own set of features and capabilities:

## Payment Model

Each payment in CoreShop, whether successful or failed, is represented by a payment model. This model contains essential
information and a reference to the relevant order.

## Creating a Payment Programmatically

To create a new payment method programmatically, use a factory and assign a unique code:

```php
$payment = $this->container->get('coreshop.factory.payment')->createNew();

$payment->setOrder($order);
$payment->setCurrencyCode('EUR');

$this->container->get('coreshop.repository.payment')->add($payment);
```
