# CoreShop Stores Theming

CoreShop Stores are designed to allow different Themes. Therefore you can have a true Multi-Store Environment with different Themes.

CoreShop uses Sylius Theme Bundle for templates, read more at their docs on how it works: [https://docs.sylius.com/en/1.9/book/themes/themes.html](https://docs.sylius.com/en/1.9/book/themes/themes.html)
