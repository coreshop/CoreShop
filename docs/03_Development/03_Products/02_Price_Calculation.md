# CoreShop Product Price Calculation

CoreShop uses multiple Price Calculators to determine the correct price for a product. Per default following Calculators are used

 - [Price Rule Calculator which uses Prices from Catalog Price Rules and Specific Price Rules](https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/blob/master/src/CoreShop/Bundle/ProductBundle/Calculator/PriceRuleCalculator.php)
 - [Store Product Price Calculator](https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/blob/master/src/CoreShop/Component/Core/Product/Calculator/StoreProductPriceCalculator.php)

These two are only the default implementations, if you need a custom Calculator, you need to implement the Interface

[```CoreShop\Component\Product\Calculator\ProductPriceCalculatorInterface```](https://github.com/coreshop/CoreShop/blob/master/src/CoreShop/Component/Product/Calculator/ProductPriceCalculatorInterface.php) and register your service with the tag
```coreshop.product.price_calculator```, a ```type``` attribute and a ```priority```

## What prices does CoreShop calculate?

CoreShop Price Calculation consists of 3 different prices:

 - **Retail Price**: Base Price without any discounts
 - **Discount Price**: Special Price for promotions. Needs to return a price smaller than retail price, otherwise retail price is valid
 - **Discount**: Discount from promotions
 - **Price**: Retail Price or Discount Price (if available) minus discount rules

## Calculator Service
If you want to calculate the Price for a Product, you need to use a special service to do that. There are two options:

**1**: ```coreshop.product.price_calculator``` which calculates prices without any tax regards.

**2**: ```coreshop.product.taxed_price_calculator``` which calculates prices with tax or without. (recommended one to use)

### Templating
If you want to calculate the price within a Template, you can do so by using the filter ```coreshop_product_price```

<div class="code-section">

```php
<?php
echo $this->coreshop_product_price($product);
```

```twig
{{ (product|coreshop_product_price(true)) }}
```

## Custom Price Calculator Example

Our Example Service will take the Property "price" - 1 as Product Price and -1 as Discount, therefore the price stays the same.
This example is only a show-case of how to add a new calculator.

> CoreShop Price calculation always depends on a context. The context per default consists of following values:
>  - Store
>  - Country
>  - Currency
>  - Customer (if logged in)
>  - Cart

```php
<?php

namespace AppBundle\CoreShop\Product;

use CoreShop\Component\Product\Calculator\ProductPriceCalculatorInterface;
use CoreShop\Component\Product\Model\ProductInterface;

final class CustomPriceCalculator implements ProductPriceCalculatorInterface
{
    /**
     * Used to determine a retail price
     */
    public function getPrice(ProductInterface $subject, array $context, $withDiscount = true)
    {
        $price = $this->getRetailPrice($subject, $context);

        return $withDiscount ? $this->getDiscount($subject, $price) : $price;
    }

    /**
     * Used to determine a retail price
     */
    public function getRetailPrice(ProductInterface $subject, array $context)
    {
        return $subject->getStorePrice($context['store']);
    }

    /**
     * Used to determine a discount
     */
    public function getDiscount(ProductInterface $subject, array $context, $price)
    {
        return 0;
    }

    /**
     * Used to determine a discounted price
     */
    public function getDiscountPrice(ProductInterface $subject, array $context)
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```

Now we need to register our service to the container and add the calculator tag:

```yaml
app.coreshop.product.price_calculator.custom:
    class: AppBundle\CoreShop\Product\CustomPriceCalculator
    tags:
      - { name: coreshop.product.price_calculator, type: custom, priority: 1 }
```

CoreShop now uses our service for all Product Price Calculations.
